										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were really excited to be featured in a recent episode of <a href="https://www.my5.tv/the-hotel-inspector/season-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Channel 5’s The Hotel Inspector</a>. Our Merit range played a part in the dramatic transformation, led by Alex Polizzi, that took place at the Richmoor Hotel in Weymouth. The restaurant and bar area was transformed into a light airy space, providing a beautiful spot for the hotel guests to sit in and enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-131" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/furniture-close-up-1024x768.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/furniture-close-up-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/furniture-close-up-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/furniture-close-up-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/furniture-close-up.jpg 1200w" alt="furniture-close-up" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>In the words of Alex Polizzi herself, they “stripped out the dated and unwelcoming bar, and replaced it with a more sophisticated restaurant. It’s a much more convivial space.” Yes, by incorporating our <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/">commercial furniture</a>, the atmosphere within the restaurant and bar was completely transformed from dull and uninspiring to lively, friendly and enjoyable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were happy to see our <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/">contract furniture</a> taking centre stage and really driving the transformation within the dining space.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-132" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alex-polizzi-in-restaurant-1024x768.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alex-polizzi-in-restaurant-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alex-polizzi-in-restaurant-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alex-polizzi-in-restaurant-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alex-polizzi-in-restaurant.jpg 1200w" alt="alex-polizzi-in-restaurant" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>It is incredible to see how simply changing the furniture within a restaurant, bar or cafe really impacts the ambiance, and plays a part in enriching your customers dining experience. Of course, the colours, textures, materials, shapes and scale of the tables and chairs you choose will build on and support the atmosphere you are creating.</p>
