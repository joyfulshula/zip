Here are some tips on how to choose high-quality contract furniture:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider the materials<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The type of material used in the construction of contract furniture can greatly impact its quality and durability. Look for pieces made from high-quality materials like solid wood, steel, aluminium or polypropylene, as these materials are more durable and can withstand heavy use over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Evaluate the construction<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When examining contract furniture, check to see how it&#8217;s constructed. Pieces that are well-constructed, with a solid core are more likely to last longer and withstand heavy use. Look for furniture that has sturdy joints, thick and durable materials, and proper finishing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Choose a reputable manufacturer<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Selecting a reputable manufacturer is essential when looking for high-quality contract furniture. Check out the manufacturer&#8217;s reputation in the industry, their reviews, and their warranty policies. This will give you an idea of the quality of their products and their commitment to customer satisfaction. Our team here at JB Commercial Furniture produces quality furniture using only our trusted factories in the UK, Europe and Asia. The majority of our items are hand-made to ensure high quality products.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider the design<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The design of the contract furniture should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also functional. Look for pieces that are ergonomically designed and can be used in a variety of settings. A well-designed piece of contract furniture will provide both style and functionality.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Check for certifications<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The strict UK Fire Regulations require furniture used in commercial premises to be CRIB5 Certified. It\u2019s also important to look for furniture that has been certified by other industry standards organisations. Certifications like, BS7176, BS5651, FSC, and ISO 9001 ensure that the furniture is made from sustainable materials, is safe for indoor use, and is of high quality.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By considering these factors when selecting contract furniture, you can ensure that you are getting high-quality, durable, and functional pieces that meet your needs and expectations. Choosing the right furniture can make all the difference in creating an environment that is both welcoming and functional.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to selecting contract furniture, there are several factors to consider to ensure that you are getting high-quality&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":406668,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[83],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.3 -
