										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ergonomic office chair is an essential piece of furniture for anyone who spends long hours sitting at a desk. These chairs are designed to promote good posture, reduce the risk of developing health problems such as back pain and neck pain, and increase comfort and productivity. In this blog post, we will discuss the benefits of an ergonomic office chair and what to look for when choosing one.</span></p>
<p><img class="" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/p1472-19.-ergo-ktag-m.1.jpg" width="170" height="170" /></p>
<h4><b>Benefits of an Ergonomic Office Chair</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotes Good Posture: An ergonomic office chair is designed to support the natural curve of your spine, which promotes good posture and reduces strain on your back and neck muscles.</span></p>
<h4><b>Reduces Risk of Health Problems</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting for long periods can increase the risk of developing health problems such as back pain, neck pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. An ergonomic office chair can help reduce these risks by providing the right support and encouraging movement.</span></p>
<h4><b>Increases Comfort</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ergonomic office chair is designed with comfort in mind. It has a cushioned seat and backrest, adjustable armrests, and a recline feature that allows you to adjust the angle of the backrest to find the most comfortable position.</span></p>
<p><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/p853-fhb-chrome-w-arms.jpg" alt="Marbella Luxury 24 hour Executive Chair" width="163" height="168" /><br />
<img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/p1472-52702-19.-ergo-ktag-m.3.jpg" width="184" height="184" /></p>
<h4><b>Improves Productivity</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are comfortable, you are more productive. An ergonomic office chair can help you stay focused and alert by reducing discomfort and fatigue.</span></p>
<h4><b>What to Look for When Choosing an Ergonomic Office Chair</b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable Seat Height: Look for a chair with an adjustable seat height so that you can adjust it to the right height for your desk.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumbar Support: A good ergonomic office chair should provide adequate lumbar support, which helps maintain the natural curve of your spine.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjustable Armrests: The armrests should be adjustable to allow you to rest your arms comfortably and to prevent shoulder and neck strain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recline Feature: Look for a chair with a recline feature, which allows you to adjust the angle of the backrest to find the most comfortable position.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathable Fabric: Look for a chair with a breathable fabric that allows air to circulate and keeps you cool and comfortable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swivel Base: A swivel base allows you to easily move around your workspace without straining your back or neck.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight Capacity: Make sure the chair you choose can support your weight.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, an ergonomic office chair is an essential piece of furniture for anyone who spends long hours sitting at a desk, or an individual who struggles to sit down at work for long periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It promotes good posture, reduces the risk of developing health problems, increases comfort, and improves productivity. When choosing an ergonomic office chair, look for one with adjustable seat height, lumbar support, adjustable armrests, a recline feature, breathable fabric, a swivel base, and a weight capacity that can support your weight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking the time to choose the right chair, you can create a comfortable and productive workspace that promotes good health and well-being.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to selecting contract furniture, there are several factors to consider to ensure that you are getting high-quality and durable pieces that meet your needs. Here are some tips on how to choose high-quality contract furniture:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consider the materials</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The type of material used in the construction of contract furniture can greatly impact its quality and durability. Look for pieces made from high-quality materials like solid wood, steel, aluminium or polypropylene, as these materials are more durable and can withstand heavy use over time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate the construction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When examining contract furniture, check to see how it&#8217;s constructed. Pieces that are well-constructed, with a solid core are more likely to last longer and withstand heavy use. Look for furniture that has sturdy joints, thick and durable materials, and proper finishing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Choose a reputable manufacturer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Selecting a reputable manufacturer is essential when looking for high-quality contract furniture. Check out the manufacturer&#8217;s reputation in the industry, their reviews, and their warranty policies. This will give you an idea of the quality of their products and their commitment to customer satisfaction. Our team here at JB Commercial Furniture produces quality furniture using only our trusted factories in the UK, Europe and Asia. The majority of our items are hand-made to ensure high quality products.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consider the design</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The design of the contract furniture should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also functional. Look for pieces that are ergonomically designed and can be used in a variety of settings. A well-designed piece of contract furniture will provide both style and functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Check for certifications</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The strict UK Fire Regulations require furniture used in commercial premises to be CRIB5 Certified. It’s also important to look for furniture that has been certified by other industry standards organisations. Certifications like, BS7176, BS5651, FSC, and ISO 9001 ensure that the furniture is made from sustainable materials, is safe for indoor use, and is of high quality.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By considering these factors when selecting contract furniture, you can ensure that you are getting high-quality, durable, and functional pieces that meet your needs and expectations. Choosing the right furniture can make all the difference in creating an environment that is both welcoming and functional.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitality commercial furniture plays an important role in creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for guests in hotels, restaurants, and other similar settings. Not only does it need to be functional and durable, but it also needs to be stylish and in line with the overall aesthetic of the establishment. First impressions count, and you could also consider your contract furniture to be a statement piece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to selecting furniture for a hospitality setting, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it&#8217;s important to choose furniture that is built to withstand heavy use and regular cleaning. This means choosing materials that are easy to clean and maintain, such as vinyl or leather for upholstery. It&#8217;s also important to choose furniture that is durable and can withstand the wear and tear of daily use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important consideration is the style and aesthetic of the furniture. The furniture should complement the overall design and theme of the establishment. For example, a modern hotel may want to choose sleek and contemporary furniture, while a more traditional hotel may want to choose more classic and elegant pieces.</span></p>
<p><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p1539-venice-highback-500.jpg" alt="VENICE DINING CHAIRS (CLASSIC) " width="162" height="162" /><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/p2939-zeni-stock-side-both-500.jpg" alt="Zeni Side Chair" width="165" height="165" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to specific types of commercial furniture, there are a few key pieces that are essential in any hospitality setting. These include seating options such as chairs and sofas, as well as tables and other surfaces for guests to use. In addition, it&#8217;s important to have a variety of seating options to accommodate guests with different needs and preferences. For example, some guests may prefer a more traditional armchair, while others may prefer a more modern, minimalist design over something more elaborate. </span></p>
<p><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p313-68155-band-armchair-veneto-cappuccino-faux-wenge-500.jpg" alt="Band Armchair" width="145" height="145" /><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/p2618-ludwig6.jpg" alt="LUDWIG Straight Sofa" width="271" height="271" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these basic pieces, it&#8217;s also important to consider other types of furniture that can enhance the guest experience. For example, a hotel may want to include a bar or lounge area for guests to relax and socialise, while a restaurant may want to choose furniture that is specifically designed for dining.</span></p>
<p><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/p2678-round_dining_lr.jpg" alt="dining table hotel" width="188" height="188" /><img class="half-width alignnone" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p2951-valuec11.jpg" alt="Valor Square Dining Table" width="174" height="174" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, when it comes to selecting hospitality commercial furniture, it&#8217;s important to choose pieces that are functional, durable, and stylish. By keeping these factors in mind, you can create a comfortable and welcoming environment for your guests and ensure that they have a pleasant and enjoyable experience at your establishment.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud to be one of over 5 million British family businesses, placing our core values at the heart of everything we do. According to the IFB, 87.6% of businesses in the UK are family-owned. But in a more competitive world where time and money are having a stronger influence on your choice of service provider, what are the benefits of working with a family-run contract furniture supplier? Spoiler alert &#8211; there’s loads!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stick to our core values</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with big companies, the process can often feel impersonal and cold. It’s easy for large corporations to become detached from where they began, focussing on profit over quality and customer care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a family-business, we place our core values at the heart of everything we do. From the very beginning with your first inquiry through to final fittings and customer support, we provide a personal, authentic and efficient service that centres around quality and precision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JB Commercial team has been entrusted with a wide range of projects and clients with businesses of all sizes. Whether it’s working with renowned hotels and bars or designing and fitting out airport lounges and school common areas, each project we work on is unique. Rather than just getting the job done as quickly and cheaply as possible, we work closely with every client to ensure we create something that goes above and beyond expectations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unmatched customer service and aftercare</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care about you and the items you order. We aren&#8217;t here to sell you furnishings which will break in a year and pretend that we don&#8217;t know who you are when you call for help. We take great pride in what we sell and who we sell it to. JB Commercial is here for you long after you’ve received your furniture, and should any problems arise, we will work hard to get it rectified ASAP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key benefit to ordering from a family owned furniture supplier is that we remember you, your business and everything you ordered. That includes the little things, like your opening times, meaning we know when you’re available for a project catch up or delivery. This streamlines the process and makes working alongside us an enjoyable and stress-free experience. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only provide the best quality commercial furniture </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re looking for top-spec contract office furniture that combines style with functionality, or a welcoming and luxurious range of commercial soft seating, we’ve got you covered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst large corporate companies may sacrifice quality and attention-to-detail by bulk building with cheap materials, we ensure that everything that leaves JB Commercial Furniture’s doors is finished to the highest standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take great pride in and regularly update our product offering, seamlessly merging style with robust materials to create your perfect setup. Whether you’re aiming for a sleek, minimalist look or creating something more cosy and traditional, our commercial furniture selection has it all!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering great value for money with competitive pricing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are financially tough right now for companies of all sizes. As a family-business ourselves, we completely understand. At JB Commercial we work hard to keep our prices competitive, but you can be sure that we will never sacrifice the quality of our products and services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer solutions to suit all budgets. So, if you’re looking for innovative layout solutions for your meeting spaces or are on the hunt for some new outdoor dining furniture, we can work alongside you and bring your vision to life. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just a business, it’s our passion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JB Commercial Furniture has been designing and fitting commercial furniture for around 18 years now, and it’s much more than just a job to us. Yes, it’s a business, so it’s important that we’re able to make it a success. But that’s a lot easier to do when you love what you do as much as we do!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two jobs are the same for us. We thrive on the challenge of maximising the space you have available whilst building imaginative solutions that are both practical and affordable. We want each of our clients to feel that ‘wow’ factor when you see your redesigned space for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/product-category/premier-collection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premier Collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a perfect example of this. Each piece within the range is handmade within the EU. It includes our most sumptuous options, such as cosy armchairs, stylish sofas and stand-out dining furniture. Fancy something especially bold? Check out our </span><a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/product/merit-square-dining-table-laminate-top-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revitalized table range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes marble effect tops and gold edging to give your space that final special touch. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any commercial furniture acquired, we recommend that due diligence is met and checks are done before purchasing to ensure that they meet British Safety Standards and are in line with ‘UK Fire Regulations 1988’. There are 3 main fire tests as set out by British Standards to meet UK Fire Regulations for commercial use. BS 5852 are the Cigarette (Source 1), Match (Source 2) and Crib 5 (Source 5) test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crib 5 test essentially means, does your furniture have a degree of fire resistance and are your chairs, sofas and any other upholstered indoor furniture at your firm flame retardant? If they are, this significantly reduces the risk of ignition which could provide your company with valuable time to save lives in the event of a fire. For health and safety reasons, this is something your firm should always check with your existing furniture and before purchasing any new contract furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At JB Commercial Furniture, all of our upholstered indoor furniture is Crib 5 tested. Crib 5 materials are commonly used in offices, the health care sector, cinemas, restaurants and cafes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For further information about our furniture and how it meets British Standards (Crib 5), please feel free to contact our team to request one of our latest contract upholstery pattern cards for our fabrics and vinyls. Otherwise, please view the </span><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1988/1324/made"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pertaining to furniture and furnishings and UK Fire Regulations (Crib 5).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the most recent news that government restrictions will end on Thursday 24th, many business owners may now be looking towards the prospect of welcoming staff back into the office more often. Whether on a hybrid or full time basis, the buzz of returning to the office is certainly something that business owners can further embrace and encapsulate through sprucing up the look and feel of their office.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core of our business function at JB Commercial Furniture is in selling and supplying direct to the end user, whether that be a business in the hospitality, leisure, healthcare sector or directly to offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What may not be as commonly known, is that our company also supplies contract furniture directly to property managers, landlords and office design and fit out firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A design and fit out firm will mostly be concerned with architectural design and structural factors such as door fittings, plumbing and  ventilation on new builds or refurbishment projects. So much so, that all of this work &#8211; once completed, is labelled as a Category A (Cat A) fit out &#8211; ultimately a finished construction, but essentially a blank canvas.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325819" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min.jpg" alt="catb_fitout" width="2200" height="1467" srcset="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min.jpg 2200w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-1367x912.jpg 1367w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AdobeStock_311311909-min-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2200px) 100vw, 2200px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although much thought and consideration may have been given to the interior design from a design and fit out firm (where contracted to take this work on), these firms typically require either one or more suppliers for commercial interior fittings, whether it be for the lighting, soft furnishings, desks and/or units. This is what’s commonly referred to in the commercial property sector as the Category B (Cat B) fit out; the space where a company can move into occupy a space and actively start working. Typically, the finished article with all of the contract furniture in situ. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are sure you don’t need us to tell you that summer has finally arrived here in the UK – and there are few things more enjoyable than getting a group of your favourite people together and heading out for some alfresco dining. So what is the secret to creating a truly irresistible outdoor restaurant or cafe space – one with a relaxing, inviting vibe?</p>
<p>A stunning trend that is a firm favourite at JB Commercial is that of decorating your outdoor restaurant terrace as if it is an extension of your interior – because why would you want to forego all of the creature comforts your customers enjoy inside your bar or restaurant?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to take your interior style to your outdoor space with ease.</p>
<h3>Furniture</h3>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to have a restaurant terrace or patio, don’t feel that you have to compromise on the flow of the design through your space, just because you have moved outside. Of course, <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/products/outdoor-furniture/72">outdoor tables and chairs</a> have some extra criteria to fulfil by nature; the quality and integrity to withstand the elements to name just one. With so many beautiful options now available though, there are possibilities aplenty to achieve your chosen design scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-114" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/outdoor-furniture-features-1024x397.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/outdoor-furniture-features-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/outdoor-furniture-features-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/outdoor-furniture-features-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/outdoor-furniture-features.jpg 1546w" alt="outdoor-furniture-features" width="640" height="248" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/products/outdoor-furniture/72">Maldives range</a> is a fantastic option with its stunning rattan finish and sleek design, paired with the durable materials it features. The use of flat Polyethylene Resin weave and the EZ Care No Wood mean that this range is completely equipped to be left outside all year round. The <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/products/outdoor-furniture/72">Maldives range</a> includes a wide choice of different products so you can mix and match to suit your own venue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-115" src="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dale-outdoor-set-1024x397.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" srcset="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dale-outdoor-set-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dale-outdoor-set-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dale-outdoor-set-768x298.jpg 768w, https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/dale-outdoor-set.jpg 1546w" alt="dale-outdoor-set" width="640" height="248" /></p>
<p>If you’re creating a more informal seating area, the <a href="https://www.jb-commercial-furniture.co.uk/product/dale-4-piece-rattan-outdoor-set">Dale Outdoor Rattan range</a> sets the tone for obligatory relaxation, combining natural rattan weave and stylish charcoal cushions. This set is also shower resistant, so no stress when those inevitable sudden showers make an appearance.</p>
<h3>Flooring</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don’t neglect your floors! Here you have an opportunity to give your guests the wow factor as they step outside, and give your beautiful new outdoor furniture something special to sit on.<br />
Bring out the rugs! By using rugs (we love the flat woven type for their durability!) you can add warmth and texture. And why stop at just one? Layer your rugs up to add another element and to really bring that cozy feel outdoors. Rugs are easy to switch in and out, so mix and match with patterns, colours and texture.<br />
If you want more of a permanent fixture, concrete tiles are just the ticket. With a never ending choice of stunning designs and patterns, you may just struggle to pick one. Once installed though, concrete tiles wear beautifully over time.<br />
Of course, you don’t have to choose between the two, as pairing tiles and rugs together works a treat.</p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>Lighting is everything when it comes to creating an electric atmosphere, so it is super important to make sure your selections are on point. Choose a mix of ambient (general) lighting, task lighting and accent lighting for your space – a good plan combining all three suited to function and style. String lighting suspended overhead is a JB favourite, easy to install whilst being high impact – perfect! Candlelight radiating from table top and lanterns, as well as the soft glow from an outdoor fire pit is unbeatable, along with the bonus benefit of heat supply, a vital element for those UK summer evenings.</p>
<h3>Plants</h3>
<p>You are outdoors, after all!<br />
There are many creative ways you can do this, from oversized floor standing planters, hanging terrariums and table top pots. Installing a vertical garden is a great high impact way to incorporate some foliage, bringing heaps of ambiance and texture, as well as working well in smaller spaces.<br />
If your outdoor space features glass, you can capitalise on the greenhouse feels – more is more!</p>
<h3>Decor</h3>
<p>Of course, while we are enjoying the heatwave, we also know that we need to cater for that moment when the chill sets in. Incorporate textiles in the form of throw cushions and blankets, creating a comfortable and cozy patio that people won’t want to leave.</p>

<p>We don’t know about you, but when we arrive at a restaurant or bar, we head straight for the hottest seats in the house – the Booth! Booth seating ticks all the boxes for us; comfort, intimacy, privacy, with a double helping of luxe. We know we certainly are not alone in our love for booth seating, which is clear to see from its regular appearances throughout the design of many beautiful restaurants.</p>
<p>Booth, banquet or fixed seating, what’s the difference you may ask? Well, all three terms refer to a similar type of seating, seating that is usually fixed to the floor and designed to seat a group of people within a particular, generally more private, area. This type of furniture can come in various shapes and sizes, for example, in long bench form or in a circular booth shape.</p>
<p>The use of fixed seating lends many advantages when designing the layout of a restaurant. From a more practical point of view, straight length and L-shaped booth seating provide a fantastic way to maximise space when installed against a wall, as well as the use of back to back seating. Where you have an awkward space, a bespoke booth can be designed to ensure you are absolutely maximising on the seating capacity in your restaurant. They can also be used as a divider in a space, perhaps creating a boundary between a formal and a more relaxed dining style. A well thought out layout design will employ the booth seating to direct traffic flow though the restaurant, adding to the ambiance within your establishment.</p>
<p>Here is a round up of our favourite looks to get that inspiration flowing.</p>
<div class="page-header">
<h2>Colour it in</h2>
</div>
<p>Your banquet seating provides a perfect platform to make a statement – go bold with colour for a high impact interior look.</p>
<div class="page-header">
<h2>Go luxe with velvet</h2>
</div>
<p>There is just something about velvet that brings in an effortless elegance and when teamed with that Chesterfield button it is utterly swoon worthy.</p>
<div class="page-header">
<h2>Mix and match with different styles of seating</h2>
</div>
<p>Incorporating a variety of seating styles will really set off your banquet seating. Pair with dining chairs, sidechairs, benches, and stools.</p>
